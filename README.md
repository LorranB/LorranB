## About Me

Designer graduated from **ESDI/UERJ**, I’m an active, sociable, and good-humored person — always tuned into the latest technological trends, with a deep passion for **games, programming, and illustration**.  

My work spans the entire communication design field, from **branding and marketing** to **web design and creative development**. Over the years, I’ve worked with:  
-  **Marketing for the Financial Market**  
-  **Promotional Materials for Specialized and Professional Courses**  
-  **E-commerce Marketing for Hospital and B2C Products**  
-  **Campaigns and major projects for Nutrition and Personalized Compounding companies**  
-  **Freelance projects for renowned restaurants in Rio de Janeiro**  
-  **Collaborations with creative agencies in Europe**

Beyond design, I have a strong foundation in **programming and interactive experiences**.  
I’ve developed a complete **2D game in Unity**, merging my skills in **C# development and pixel art** to bring design and logic together.  

I’ve also assisted several colleagues in **Python university projects**, and even mentored a friend throughout her **Systems Development course**, helping her create multiple working applications.  

I enjoy building **websites from scratch** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, blending design precision with solid front-end development practices to create functional and beautiful digital experiences.  

Currently, I’m pursuing a **degree in Systems Analysis and Development** and a **postgraduate specialization in Software Engineering**, both at **UniAmérica**.  

My focus lies in **communication design, branding, marketing, illustration, and programming** especially where **design meets technology**.  
I’m constantly seeking ways to turn ideas into interactive, visual, and meaningful realities.
